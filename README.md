In this script, I have created a code where I analyze the positives and negatives reviews for a hotel in Berlin NLP.

The interesting part is that, I wanted to see the difference between countries when it comes to reviews, and it turns out that they are real.
Germans when givinf good reviews always talk about amenities and locationf. On the other hand, French are more likely to talk about how the staff treated them.
English reviews can be tricky to analyse, once that the probability of a person who was not born in a native english speaking country create a review in english is very high.
